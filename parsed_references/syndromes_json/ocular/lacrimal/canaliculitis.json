      "text": "Canaliculitis is an infection of the lacrimal canaliculus, the small channel in the eyelid that drains tears into the lacrimal sac. It is a relatively uncommon cause of chronic, unilateral red eye and discharge. It is often misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis or dacryocystitis. The most common causative organism is Actinomyces israelii, a filamentous gram-positive bacterium, which characteristically forms concretions (sulfur granules) within the canaliculus."
