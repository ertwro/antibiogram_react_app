      "text": "Candida endophthalmitis is the most common form of endogenous (hematogenous) endophthalmitis. It occurs when Candida species, typically Candida albicans, spread to the eye through the bloodstream from a distant site of infection. Major risk factors include candidemia, central venous catheters, recent abdominal surgery, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), broad-spectrum antibiotic use, and intravenous drug use. The infection seeds the highly vascular choroid and retina."

Anterior chamber inflammation and hypopyon can also occur."
