      "text": "Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) keratitis is a rare and challenging-to-treat corneal infection caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium abscessus. These infections are often associated with ocular trauma or surgery, particularly LASIK, where the infection can develop at the flap interface. Contaminated water sources or non-sterile surgical instruments can be a source of infection."
