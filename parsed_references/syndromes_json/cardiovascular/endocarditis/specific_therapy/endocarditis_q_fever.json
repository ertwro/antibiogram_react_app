        "Use of tetracyclines in pediatric patients has historically been limited because of reports of permanent tooth discoloration in children <8 years of age caused by incorporation of the drugs and their colored degradation products in enamel. Doxycycline binds less readily to calcium compared with other members of the tetracycline class, and recent comparative data suggest that doxycycline is not likely to cause visible teeth staining or enamel hypoplasia in children <8 years of age. Doxycycline can safely be administered for short durations (\u226421 days) regardless of patient age (AAP Red Book 2018, Section 4; J Pediatr 2015; 166:1246).",
