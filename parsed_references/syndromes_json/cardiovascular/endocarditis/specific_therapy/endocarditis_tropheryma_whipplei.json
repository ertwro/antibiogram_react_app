        "German study of explanted valve material suggests that Tropheryma whipplei may be the fourth most common cause of endocarditis (after staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci) and the most common cause of culture-negative endocarditis, accounting for approximately a third of cases. Patients typically do not have other signs and symptoms of Whipple's disease, have slowly progressive valvular disease, and do not meet Duke criteria for diagnosis of endocarditis (J Clin Micro 50:216, 2012).",
        "Diagnosis can only be established by histopathologic examination, culture, or PCR of valve material."
