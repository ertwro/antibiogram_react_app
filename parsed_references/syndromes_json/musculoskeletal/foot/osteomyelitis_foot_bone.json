        "Case series of microbiology of puncture wound soft-tissue and bone infections of the foot found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant pathogen in non-diabetics versus S. aureus in diabetics. Polymicrobial infections were common, 83% in diabetics and 53% in non-diabetics (J Am Podiatr Med Assoc. 2020 Nov 2;20-206)",
