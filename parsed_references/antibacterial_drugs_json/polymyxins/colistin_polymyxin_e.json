      "For all indications other than UTI, polymyxin B is preferred over colistin because of equivalent efficacy, faster attainment of target serum concentrations, less interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics, no dose adjustment for renal impairment and lower risk of renal toxicity (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2016;60: 2443; Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2017:61: e02319-16).",

      "The plasmid-encoded colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, has been found in E. coli and Klebsiella sp. Resistance is due to modification of the lipid A target of the polymyxins. Strains may also produce metallo-carbapenemases, resulting in pan-resistance (See Lancet Infect Dis 2016;16:161; Lancet Infect Dis 2016;16:287; Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2016;60:4420).",
      "No clear alternatives for a companion drug with colistin.",

      "Combination therapy with a polymyxin (either colistin or polymyxin B) plus a carbapenem is no longer recommended for treatment of carbapenem-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae (KPCs), Acinetobacter sp., and P. aeruginosa.",
      "The combination of colistin + meropenem was no more effective than colistin monotherapy in a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (Lancet Infect Dis 2018;18:391).",
      "Most (77%) of the infections were due to A. baumannii; the trial was underpowered to address efficacy vs KPCs and P. aeruginosa.",

      "In vitro and in vivo exposure to polymyxins results in rapid selection of resistant subpopulations. In vitro, minocycline prevented emergence of resistance and augmented colistin activity, but no clinical trial data. Tigecycline may function similarly, but no data."
