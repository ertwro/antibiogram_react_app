      "Sulopenem etzadroxil-probenecid is Indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI caused by E. coli, K. pneumoniae, or P. mirabilis in adult women with limited or no alternative oral treatment options.",
      "Sulopenem etzadroxil is a thiopenem ester prodrug that is hydrolyzed to sulopenem (a substrate of OAT3) upon oral administration. Systemic exposure is boosted by probenecid (an OAT1 and OAT3 inhibitor).",
      "Sulopenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). In E. coli, binding affinity is as follows: PBP2 > PBP1A > PBP2A > PBP4 > PBP3 > PBP5/6.",
      "Resistance to sulopenem is mediated by certain ESBLs including carbapenemases, altered PBPs, efflux pumps, and loss of outer membrane porin channels. Active against Enterobacterales in the presence of certain beta-lactamases: AmpC, CTX-M, TEM, SHV.",
      "Some drug-drug interactions are expected (see chart below). Of note, no clinically significant reduction in valproic acid concentrations has been observed following concurrent use (in contrast to carbapenems).",
      "May interfere with copper sulfate urine glucose tests, resulting in a false-positive for glycosuria.",
      "Good review: Drugs 2022;82:533."
