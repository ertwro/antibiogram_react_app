    "description": [
      "Methenamine hippurate and Methenamine mandelate are urinary antiseptics that are used to prevent or suppress recurrent urinary tract infections.",
      "Useful in suppressive therapy after infecting organisms are cleared, but not for pyelonephritis.",
      "Methenamine is hydrolyzed to ammonia and formaldehyde in acidic urine (pH 5.5). It is the formaldehyde that kills bacteria, presumably by denaturing bacterial proteins.",
      "Do not force fluids (may dilute the formaldehyde).",
      "Of no value in patients with chronic Foley.",
      "Restrict administration of alkalinizing foods and drugs.",
      "If urine pH >5.5, co-administer ascorbic acid (up to 1-2 gm po q4h) to acidify the urine.",
      "Cranberry juice (12004000 mL per day) has been used with mixed results.",
      "May be less effective in situations in which a more alkaline pH is created by urea-splitting bacteria in the urine, such as Proteus or Pseudomonas.",
      "A systematic review found comparable efficacy of methenamine hippurate and antibiotics in preventing symptomatic UTIs and reducing positive urine cultures. However, higher asymptomatic bacteriuria rates in the methenamine group merit further investigation (BMC Urol 2025;25:30)."
