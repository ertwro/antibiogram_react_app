      "Nitrofurantoin is used to treat uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI), e.g., cystitis, urethritis.",
      "Not effective for infections outside of the urinary tract.",
      "Because nitrofurantoin is a weak acid with a pKa of 7.2, absorption is enhanced in an acidic environment. Renal clearance is enhanced in an alkaline environment (Urology 1988;32:67).",
      "Increased activity in acidic urine.",
      "Original marketed form was nitrofurantoin microcrystals (Furadantin), which caused a lot of nausea. The drug was later formulated in a macrocrystalline form (Macrodantin) with slower dissolution and less Gl toxicity. Both products dosed four times daily for UTI treatment, however. Finally, a longer acting form (Macrobid): 25% macrocrystals (slower dissolution than monohydrate), 75% monohydrate that forms a gel matrix and releases nitrofurantoin slowly over time after coming into contact with Gl fluids. This is the basis for twice-daily dosing.",
      "Long-standing admonition to not use in patients with CrCl <50-60 mL/min for fear of inadequate urine concentrations and/or increased adverse effects. However, in retrospective study, there was no difference in the safety and efficacy of nitrofurantoin in patients with CrCl ",
      "50 mL/min or CrCl >50 mL/min. Current American Geriatric Society recommendation is that nitrofurantoin can be used with relative safety and efficacy in patients with CrCl >30 mL/min (J Am Geriatr Soc 67:674, 2019). Not effective in end-stage renal disease.",
