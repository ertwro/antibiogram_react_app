      "Pivmecillinam is the pivalate ester prodrug of mecillinam (amdinocillin).",
      "FDA approved 04/24/2024 for uncomplicated UTI caused by susceptible E. coli, P. mirabilis, and S. saprophyticus.",
      "S. saprophyticus MICs a bit higher but, presumably due to high urine concentrations, reported cure rates of 73-92%.",
      "Enterobacterales producing ESBLs are susceptible, but P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S. aureus are resistant.",
      "The pivalate ester enhances bioavailability. Following absorption, pivmecillinam is hydrolyzed to mecillinam plus pivalate by nonspecific esterases in the blood, Gl tract, and elsewhere. The pivalate is converted to pivaloylcarnitine through pivaloyl-CoA and is excreted in the urine; therefore, prolonged administration can result in carnitine deficiency and defects in fatty acid oxidation.",
      "Unlike most beta-lactams, mecillinam preferentially targets PBP-2 in the bacterial cell wall.",
      "Advantages include low resistance rates and minimal propensity for collateral damage, but efficacy for uncomplicated UTI may be inferior to other options.",
      "Not effective for pyelonephritis (inadequate concentrations in renal tissue).",
      "US product: pivmecillinam 185 mg is equivalent to pivmecillinam hydrochloride 200 mg."
