      "Primary endpoint: Therapeutic response at TOC visit (day 10-13), defined as combined clinical success (complete symptom resolution) and microbiological success (reduction of qualifying uropathogens to <103 CFU/mL) without other systemic antimicrobial use.",
      "In EAGLE-2, the therapeutic success rate was 50.6% for gepotidacin and 47.0% for nitrofurantoin (adjusted difference 4.3%, 95% CI -3.6 to 12.1). In EAGLE-3, the therapeutic success rate was 58.5% for gepotidacin and 43.6% for nitrofurantoin (adjusted difference 14.6%, 95% CI 6.4 to 22.8). Statistically, non-inferiority of gepotidacin was demonstrated in both studies, and superiority in EAGLE-3.",
      "The most common adverse event with gepotidacin was diarrhea (14% in EAGLE-2 and 18% in EAGLE-3), whereas the most common adverse event with nitrofurantoin was nausea (4% in both EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3).",
