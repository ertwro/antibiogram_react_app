    "description": "Topical antibacterials used to treat mild skin infections. Various ointment preparations: Bacitracin (complexed with zinc to improve stability), Bacitracin + Polymyxin B, Bacitracin + Polymyxin B + Neomycin (referred to as triple-antibiotic ointment). All three of above available without a prescription. Bacitracin is active against staphylococci, streptococci, and Clostridium species. Polymyxin B is active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria but not Proteus sp., Serratia sp. Not active vs. Gram-positive bacteria. Neomycin is active vs. Gram-negative bacteria and staphylococci. Not active vs. streptococci. Triple-antibiotic ointments have broader spectrum than mupirocin alone and may be active against mupirocin-resistant strains (Diag Micro Inf Dis 54:63, 2006). The USA300 clone of CA-MRSA (community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus) has been found resistant to both neomycin and bacitracin in 50% of 18 isolates (Emerg Infect Dis 17:1917, 2011); also deficient MRSA bactericidal activity in time-kill studies (J Antimicrob Chemo 62:769, 2008).",
