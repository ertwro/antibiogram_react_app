    "description": "Fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (Vowst, VOS), the second live biotherapeutic product (LBP) to be approved by the US FDA, is a bacterial spore suspension in capsules for oral administration. It is indicated to prevent the recurrence of C. difficile infection (CDI) in individuals â‰¥18 years of age following antibacterial treatment for recurrent CDI. Not indicated for treatment of CDI. VOS is sourced from qualified donors after screening for pathogens. Donated stool is filtered and centrifuged, and the supernatant is treated with ethanol to kill vegetative organisms. It is then pelleted by centrifugation, washed with normal saline, resuspended with glycerol, and transferred to capsules. The goal is between 1 x 10^6 and 3 x 10^7 CFU of Firmicutes spores per capsule. Each patient receives VOS from a single donor, but each donor may contribute stool to multiple lots. Good review: Clin Infect Dis 2023;77(Suppl 6):S487.",
