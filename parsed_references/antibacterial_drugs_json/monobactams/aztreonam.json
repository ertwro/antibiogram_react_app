      "Aztreonam is a monobactam beta-lactam antibiotic that is active in vitro against many isolates of Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative organisms.",
      "The drug has no useful activity against gram-positive organisms or anaerobes.",
      "Stable in presence of Ambler class B metallo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases) produced by multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria. Unfortunately, the same bacteria usually also produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases that do inactivate aztreonam.",
      "Aztreonam can be used in many patients who are allergic to other beta-lactam antibiotics, as cross-hypersensitivity is rare.",
      "Exception: Aztreonam has an R-1 side chain that is identical to that of ceftazidime and cefiderocol, so in those with allergy to that side chain, there may be cross-sensitivity.",
      "Cross allergenicity between aztreonam and ceftazidime reported in 1 of 26 patients in a case series: J Antimicrob Chemother 2021; 76: 2741.",
