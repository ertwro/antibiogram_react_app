Therefore, there is minimal concern for a hypersensitivity reaction to a non-antimicrobial sulfonamide in a patient with a history of a reaction to TMP-SMX or any other sulfonamide antimicrobial, including dapsone, a sulfone (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2022;150:1333).",

Hyponatremia, thought most likely due to natriuresis although a recent report suggests SIADH (Medicine 2020;99:e20746). Crystalluria due to precipitation of SMX.
