      "Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.",

      "In vitro spectrum of antibacterial activity includes:",
      "Streptococci and staphylococci, including strains resistant to levofloxacin.",
      "Delafloxacin is the first fluoroquinolone with activity vs. methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA).",
      "MRSA is included in the SSSI indication but not the CABP indication.",
      "Selected gram-negative bacteria: e.g, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. .",
      "Stable in the presence of ESBLs.",
      "Less active vs P. aeruginosa than ciprofloxacin.",
      "In vitro active vs both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria: e.g., Peptostreptococcus sp and Bacteroides fragilis.",
      "In vitro activity vs Legionella pneumophilia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
      "In two randomized prospective clinical trials of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, Delafloxacin was non-inferior to the control arm of a combination of Vancomycin + Aztreonam.",
      "Limited clinical trial details are provided in the package insert.",
      "It appears that patients suffered a mixture of suppurative (often S. aureus) to non-suppurative (often streptococcal species) infections.",
      "Of note, in six Delafloxacin patients, the skin infection was complicated by S. aureus bacteremia (not clear if MRSA) and 5 of 6 \"responded\". Bacteremia occurred once due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, once due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa; both patients responded to Delafloxacin therapy.",
      "The intravenous formulation of Delafloxacin contains the excipient sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBECD) as a solubilizing agent. SBECD is cleared exclusively by the kidneys so it may accumulate in moderate to severe renal impairment. Clinical significance of this is not clear."
