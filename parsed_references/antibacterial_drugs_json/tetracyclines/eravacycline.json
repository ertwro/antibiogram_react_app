    "description": "Eravacycline, FDA-approved in 2018, is a synthetic fluorocycline antibiotic within the tetracycline class indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by certain susceptible bacteria in adults.",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Disruption of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains.",
    "in_vitro_activity": "In vitro activity is very broad and similar to tigecycline, but MICs are often twofold lower than tigecycline (J Antibiot (Tokyo) 2016;69:600; Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2013;57:5548)",

        "Increase dose to 1.5 mg/kg IV q12h if co-administered with a strong CYP3A inducer, e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine. No dosage adjustment is necessary if co-administered with a weak or moderate CYP3A inducer."
