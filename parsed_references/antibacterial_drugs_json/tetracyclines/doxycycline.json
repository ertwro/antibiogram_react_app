    "description": "Doxycycline, FDA approved in 1967, is a tetracycline antibiotic. The drug binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibits the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site. This prevents peptide chain elongation and inhibits protein synthesis. It is considered bacteriostatic.",

      "Two forms: hyclate and monohydrate. Both are equally effective. The monohydrate has reduced Gl side effects compared to the hyclate due to slower dissolution in the esophagus. However, it is not as bioavailable at higher pH as the other forms (could be an issue in patients on long term acid suppression).",
      "Pediatric use. Use of tetracyclines in pediatric patients has historically been limited because of reports of permanent tooth discoloration in children age <8 years caused by incorporation of the drugs and their colored degradation products in enamel. Doxycycline binds less readily to calcium compared with other members of the tetracycline class, and recent comparative data suggest that doxycycline is not likely to cause visible teeth staining or enamel hypoplasia in children age <8 years. The American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends that doxycycline can safely be administered without regard to the patient's age or duration of therapy (AAP Red Book 2024-2027, Section 4).",
