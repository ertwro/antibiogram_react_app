      "Fosfomycin is a low molecular weight (138 g/mol) phosphonic acid derivative. The IV preparation is fosfomycin disodium.",
      "Mechanism of action: Inhibition of MurA (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvyltransferase), which catalyzes the first committed step in peptidoglycan synthesis. Considered bactericidal with time-dependent killing.",
      "In vitro activity:",
      "In vitro activity includes ESBL-producing and some carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (Int J Antimicrob Agents 2011;37:415).",
      "Activity often enhanced when tested in combination: e.g., carbapenems increased fosfomycin activity vs P. aeruginosa in a hollow-fiber infection model (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2018;62:e01682-18).",
      "Gram-positive bacteria: Staph. aureus (including MRSA), Staph. epidermidis, Strep. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, VRE.",
      "Gram-negative bacteria: E. coli, Proteus sp., Klebsiella/Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Salmonella sp., Citrobacter sp., Providencia sp.",
      "Resistance:",
      "Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., and Bacteroides sp. are resistant.",
      "Resistance primarily chromosomal; rare plasmid-mediated resistance.",
      "Mechanisms: decrease in drug transport across the cell wall, or enzymatic alteration of the drug.",
      "Cross resistance to other classes of antibiotics is rare.",
      "Clinical use:",
      "Parenteral therapy for a wide variety of system infections. For oral formulation, see Fosfomycin po.",
      "Availability:",
      "Parenteral (IV) formulation is approved and available in Europe, Australia, and Canada (as of May 2019).",
      "U.S.: Possible to obtain emergency use of IV drug: single patient IND from the Division of Anti-infective Products at the FDA (Main number: 1-888-463-6332 or (+)1-301-796-1400; Emergency operations: (+) 1-301-796-8240 or 1-866-300-4374)."
