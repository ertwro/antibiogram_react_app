      "Fidaxomicin, FDA approved in 2011, is an oral macrolide antibiotic for treatment of moderately severe to severe C. difficile toxin-mediated diarrhea.",
      "More potent than vancomycin in vitro vs. C. difficile, including the hypervirulent NAP1/B1/027 strains.",
      "Minimal absorption; high fecal concentration; limited activity against bowel flora.",
      "More efficacious (though very expensive); latest guidelines recommend as first line therapy if feasible: Clin Infect Dis 2021;73:755; Med Lett Drugs Ther 2021;63:137.",
      "Fidaxomicin had lower rate of recurrence than vancomycin for diarrhea with non-NAP1 strains (N Engl J Med 2011;364:422; Lancet Infect Dis 2012;12:281). For patients who required concomitant antibiotics during treatment of C. difficile infection, 10-day fidaxomicin treatment reported to result in higher cure and lower relapse rate than vancomycin (Clin Infect Dis 2011;53:440).",

In a large database analysis (compared to patients without macrolide allergies), the odds of fidaxomicin allergy were 2.31, 8.37, and 1.58 times higher in patients with azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin allergies, respectively. The highest risk of anaphylaxis and angioedema was observed within one year of the initial allergy (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2025;69:e0192424)."
