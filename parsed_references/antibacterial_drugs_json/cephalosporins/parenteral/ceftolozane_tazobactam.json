      "The product exists in a 2:1 ratio of ceftolozane to tazobactam. Doses are expressed as the sum of the components. For example. ceftolozane-tazobactam 1.5 gm = ceftolozane 1 gm + tazobactam 0.5 gm.",

      "Active vs. most aerobic gram-negative bacilli that produce extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and P. aeruginosa. Not active vs many anaerobes, enterococci and staphylococci.",
      "Stable in the presence of ESBLs and at least some AmpC cephalosporinases (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2014;58:3091). Not a good substrate for efflux pumps.",
      "Susceptibility trends in European gram-negative isolates: J Antimicrob Chemother 2020;75:2907.",
      "An alternative antibiotic for drug resistant genotypes.",
      "In trials of efficacy for both complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated UTI, the clinical cure rate in the microbiological intent-to-treat patients with CrCl between 30-50 mL/min was lower than patients in the control arm. There was no difference in patients with CrCl >50 mL/min.",
      "One hypothesis for this observation: Initial dosing is calculated based on transiently elevated serum creatinine at initiation of therapy.",
      "In a retrospective review, AKI present at admission resolved within 48 hours in 57% of patients. In critically ill patients, the authors suggest deferred renal dosage adjustment during the first 48 hours until it is clear whether renal function will improve with hydration and other measures (Clin Infect Dis 2019;68:1596).",
