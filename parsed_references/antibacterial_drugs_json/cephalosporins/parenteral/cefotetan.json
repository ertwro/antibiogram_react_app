      "Cefotetan, FDA-approved in 1985, is a 2nd-generation parenteral cephalosporin (technically a cephamycin).",
      "Cephamycins are unique among cephalosporins for their activity against B. fragilis.",
      "Note that there is increasing resistance of B. fragilis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens (most common in pelvic infections).",
      "Often used for surgical prophylaxis when anaerobic gram-negative bacilli are a concern.",
      "Cefotetan is the only cephalosporin currently marketed in the US that contains the N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) side chain. Others include cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefmenoxime, cefoperazone, and moxalactam (some or all marketed elsewhere).",
      "Data suggest an increased risk of hypoprothrombinemia and INR prolongation, presumably due to interference with vitamin K activation. However, impact on bleeding risk is not clear.",
      "NMTT-containing cephalosporins vary in their potential to affect hemostasis. Cefotetan appears low risk.",
      "Reference: Int J Environ Res Public Health 2019;16:3937."
