      "In a trial of complicated intra-abdominal infection, for patients with CrCl 30-50 mL/min death rate was higher among Ceftazidime-avibactam treated patients than controls (Meropenem); however, dosing was lower than currently recommended for this range of renal function.",
      "There was no difference in patients with CrCl > 50 mL/min. There is no clear explanation for this observation.",
      "One hypothesis: Initial dosing calculated based on elevated serum creatinine at time of admission. Elevated creatinine resolved within 48 hrs in 57% of patients in a retrospective review (Clin Infect Dis 2019;68; 1596).",
      "In critically ill, suggest full dosage until clear whether renal function will improve with hydration and other measures.",
      "Resistance found in archived clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. Resistance not due to beta-lactamases. Resistance due to efflux pumps and reduced membrane permeability (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 59:1020, 2015). Could restore susceptibility in vitro with Fosfomycin.",
      "Approval for nosocomial pneumonia based on controlled trial. For results see: Lancet Infect Dis 18:285, 2018; Lancet Infect Dis 18:229, 2018."
