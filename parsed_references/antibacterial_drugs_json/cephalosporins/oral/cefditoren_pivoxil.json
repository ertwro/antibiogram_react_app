      "Cefditoren pivoxil is a 3rd generation cephalosporin active in vitro against M. catarrhalis, streptococci and H. influenzae. It is more active than 1st generation or 2nd generation cephalosporins against E. coli, P. mirabilis, and Klebsiella sp.",
      "Used in the treatment of respiratory infections and skin and skin structure infections.",
      "Cefditoren pivoxil is an ester prodrug, hydrolyzed by esterases as it is absorbed to form cefditoren and pivalate. Pivalate absorbed (70%) & becomes pivaloylcarnitine which is renally excreted; 39–63%↓ in serum carnitine concentrations. Carnitine involved in fatty acid (FA) metabolism & FA transport into mitochondria. Effect potentially reversible. See Adverse Effects.",
      "Also contains caseinate (milk protein); avoid if milk allergy (not same as lactose intolerance). Need gastric acid for optimal absorption.",
      "Where available. No longer marketed in US."
