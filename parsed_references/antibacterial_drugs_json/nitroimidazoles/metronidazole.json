      "Both parent metronidazole and hepatic metabolites are bactericidal vs. susceptible anaerobic bacteria; the result is a collective long serum half-life of 9.5 hrs.",
      "The long half-life suggests the possibility of once daily dosing. Levofloxacin plus metronidazole (both dosed once daily) was compared to moxifloxacin monotherapy vs. a mixed infection of E. coli and B. fragilis in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model, with results demonstrating similar efficacy (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2005;49:685).",
      "The efficacy of metronidazole 1.5 gm IV q24h for intra-abdominal infections was equivalent to comparator regimens in a randomized open study (Eur J Surg 1999;165:875) and in a retrospective chart review (J Chemother 2007;19:410).",
      "Although metronidazole 1.5 gm IV q24h is standard in Europe and makes pharmacokinetic sense, a formal prospective randomized trial is desirable to confirm efficacy and safety in patients with severe intra-abdominal infections.",
      "Rates of reduced susceptibility of Bacteroides spp. to metronidazole are very low (J Antimicrob Chemother 2018;73:265). Best characterized resistance mechanism is nim genes (chromosomal or plasmid-borne). These genes reduce metronidazole to a nontoxic metabolite.",
