      "Clindamycin, approved in 1970, is a versatile antimicrobial agent with a spectrum that includes aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and certain protozoa.",
      "Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit at a site very close to the macrolide binding site. Protein synthesis is inhibited, probably because of interference with transpeptidation. Clindamycin may also promote tRNA dissociation from the ribosome.",
      "Activity against Bacteroides fragilis has been declining, and rates of resistance world-wide approach 60% (Clin Infect Dis 2014;59:698). Accordingly, clindamycin is no longer recommended for treatment of intraabdominal infections.",
      "Clindamycin remains active against roughly 80% of isolates of Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium although there can be wide geographic differences in susceptibility.",
      "Useful for treatment of infections due to anaerobic bacteria involving the head, neck, and lungs. Active vs. Actinomycetes spp. and peptostreptococci (both metronidazole-resistant).",
      "MRSA: Community strains often susceptible, hospital strains generally resistant. No activity vs. enterococci.",
