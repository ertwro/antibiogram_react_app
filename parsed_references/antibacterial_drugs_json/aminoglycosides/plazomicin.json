    "description": "Plazomicin, approved in 2018, is a semisynthetic aminoglycoside derived from sisomicin. FDA approved for treatment of adults, age ≥18 years, with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis, caused by E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. cloacae. Clinical significance of in vitro data for other GNB is unknown. May be active against Enterobacteriaceae resistant to beta-lactams and other classes of antibacterials. Stable in the presence of many clinically relevant aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. Inactive vs isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases. May have reduced activity vs Enterobacteriaceae that express efflux pumps or have impaired cell wall permeability due to porin closure. Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is variable. No activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or anaerobes. Safety and efficacy data are limited, hence, plazomicin should be used only when there are limited or no alternative treatment options. Ideally, susceptibility results should be obtained first.",
