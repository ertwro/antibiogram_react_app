    "Possible increased incidence of acute kidney injury. Does combining vancomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam amplify the risk of vancomycin nephrotoxicity? Many observational retrospective studies have reported an increased risk of acute kidney injury in association with the combination of piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin as compared to either drug alone (Clin Infect Dis 2017;65:2137). No reported increased risk of AKI if vancomycin is combined with cefepime or meropenem (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2018;62:e00264-18). The attributable nephrotoxicity due to vancomycin due in part to multiple confounders (J Antimicrob Chemother 75:1031, 2020). In virtually all the pertinent studies the acute kidney injury endpoints utilized serum creatinine changes as a surrogate marker for changes in the glomerular filtration rate. In a rat model of vancomycin nephrotoxicity, there was a lack of augmentation of toxicity with concomitant piperacillin/tazobactam . Rather than changes in serum creatinine, a specific marker of tubular toxicity was utilized. The authors speculate that the rise in serum creatinine with piperacillin/tazobactam is the consequence of piperacillin competing with creatinine for tubular secretion. In short, a functional and not toxic marker. See Clin Infect Dis 71:426, 2020. Reference: J Antimicrob Chemother 75:1228, 2020."
