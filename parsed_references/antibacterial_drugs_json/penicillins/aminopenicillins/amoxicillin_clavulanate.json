      "Amoxicillin-clavulanate, FDA approved in 1984, is the co-formulation of an aminopenicillin (amoxicillin) plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanate (clavulanic acid). Clavulanic acid extends the spectrum to selected beta-lactamase producing bacteria.",
      "Clavulanic acid is a naturally occurring ẞ-lactam isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus with essentially no antibacterial activity of its own. It inhibits only narrow-spectrum penicillinases, and TEM and SHV (Ambler Class A) enzymes found in common gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Clavulanic acid inhibits no Class B, C, or D enzymes.",
      "Amoxicillin-clavulanate is available in a somewhat bewildering array of oral formulations. See the Adult Dose section below for a complete listing.",
      "IV formulation (5:1) available in some countries (not in the US).",
      "Doses are based on the amoxicillin component. They are expressed below as mg as the amoxicillin component/mg of the clavulanate component, e.g., 500 mg/125 mg.",
      "Amoxicillin is eliminated by the kidney, whereas clavulanate undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. As the dose of a combination is decreased in renal impairment, a relative clavulanate deficiency can occur (JAMA 2001;285:386). Thus, lower-ratio products (e.g., 4:1 amoxicillin:clavulanate) are preferred if CrCl <30 mL/min. See Renal Adjustment table below."

Onset of injury is a few days to as long as 8 weeks after initiation of therapy. Often occurs after the course of amoxicillin-clavulanate is completed. Typical presentation: fatigue, low grade fever, nausea and abdominal pain, followed by pruritus and jaundice. The pattern of liver enzyme elevations is typically cholestatic with marked elevations in alkaline phosphatase and GGT, as well as bilirubin. In some instances, aminotransferase levels are markedly elevated, giving a mixed or hepatocellular pattern, particularly in younger patients with earlier onset of injury. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) related to amoxicillin-clavulanate has been associated with HLA-DRB1*15:01 and its haplotype, DQB1*06:02, and with HLA-A*02:01 in northern European populations. DILI is selective on the basis of HLA restriction, and no cross-reactivity with other beta-lactams is apparent. Given the low positive predictive value of these alleles for DILI, testing is not a part of routine clinical practice (N Engl J Med 2019;381:2338).
