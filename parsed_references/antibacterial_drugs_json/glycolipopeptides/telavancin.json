      "Telavancin is a parenteral lipoglycopeptide antibiotic approved for treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) due to Staph. aureus (MSSA, MRSA), Vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus group. For review of the drug: Clin Infect Dis 60:787, 2015; Med Lett 52:1, 2010; Clin Infect Dis 61:S35, 2015)",
      "Telavancin is also approved for the treatment of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia due to Staph. aureus (MSSA, MRSA). Telavancin was non-inferior to Vancomycin in a published study of hospital-acquired pneumonia that included MRSA pneumonia (Clin Infect Dis 52:31, 2011).",
      "An alternative antibiotic for drug resistant genotypes.",
      "Telavancin has concentration-dependent bactericidal activity with dual mechanism of action: inhibition of synthesis of cell wall and disruption of bacterial cell membrane barrier.",
      "In skin infection trial, elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 3.4% of Telavancin patients and 1.2% of Vancomycin patients. Confounded by concomitant exposure to other nephrotoxic drugs/contrast agents, etc. Reversible when Telavancin is stopped. In small retrospective study of 21 patients receiving salvage therapy, 7 (33%) developed acute renal injury; complicated patients, more data needed: J Antimicrob Chemother 67:723, 2012.",
