      "Rifamycin SV is a poorly absorbed member of the rifamycin (technically ansamycin) class of antibiotics that was actually the first to be used in clinical practice (1963). In theory the product's MMX (multimatrix) technology allows for release of active antibiotic only after it reaches pH levels of ≥7 in the distal small bowel and colon, with an additional 1 hour delay upon reaching this pH.",
