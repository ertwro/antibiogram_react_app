    "description": "Rifaximin, FDA-approved in 2004, is a non-absorbable antibiotic of the Rifamycin class. It is effective in the treatment of the enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative E. coli that in turn cause traveler's diarrhea (TD).",
    "notes": [
      "Virtually none of the drug is absorbed from the Gl tract. Antimicrobial activity is in the lumen of small intestine. Bile acids improve antimicrobial effect (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2010;54:3618)."
