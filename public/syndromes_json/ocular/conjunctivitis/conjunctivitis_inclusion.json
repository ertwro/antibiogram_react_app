      "text": "Inclusion conjunctivitis is a sexually transmitted ocular infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes D-K. It typically affects sexually active young adults and is often associated with a concurrent asymptomatic genital infection. The infection is transmitted to the eye via autoinoculation from infected genital secretions. In newborns, it presents as ophthalmia neonatorum, acquired during passage through an infected birth canal."
