It is a common cause of \"pink eye,\" characterized by conjunctival injection and purulent or mucopurulent discharge. Common causative organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is typically self-limiting but is often treated with topical antibiotics to speed recovery and reduce transmission."
