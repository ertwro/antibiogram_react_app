      "text": "Osteomyelitis of the foot in persons with diabetes is a common and serious complication of diabetic foot infections (DFIs). It is a form of contiguous osteomyelitis with vascular insufficiency. The triad of neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and immunopathy in diabetes creates a high-risk environment. A seemingly minor skin ulceration can penetrate deep into the underlying bone, leading to infection. It is a major risk factor for lower-extremity amputation."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "A foot ulcer, often at a site of trauma or pressure unnoticed due to sensory neuropathy, serves as the portal of entry for bacteria. The infection spreads through the soft tissue to the bone. Poor blood supply from peripheral artery disease impairs the delivery of antibiotics and immune cells, hindering the ability to fight the infection and heal the wound."

          "interpretation": "The presence of a deep or large (>2 cmÂ²) foot ulcer, or an ulcer that has been present for a long time, increases suspicion. The single best clinical sign is a positive 'probe-to-bone' test, where a sterile, blunt metal probe can be passed through the ulcer crater directly to bone. This has a high positive predictive value."

          "interpretation": "Plain X-rays are the first step but may be negative for 2-4 weeks. They may show bone destruction, cortical erosion, or periosteal reaction. MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging test. It can detect bone marrow edema (a sign of osteomyelitis) and differentiate it from soft-tissue abscess or Charcot neuroarthropathy."
