    "Based on a 2011 global survey of ~ 5,000 S. aureus isolates, for MSSA approx. 94% were susceptible to Tetracycline and >98% were susceptible to minocycline. For MRSA, approx. 85% were susceptible to Tetracycline, and 88.3% (by Eucast breakpoint) or 97.2% (by CLSI breakpoint) were susceptible to Minocycline (Diag Microbiol Infect Dis 75:402, 2013).",
    "Avoid Telavancin in pregnancy; potential for fetal risk."
