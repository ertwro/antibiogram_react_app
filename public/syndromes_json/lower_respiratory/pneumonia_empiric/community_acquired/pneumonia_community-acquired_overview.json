        "Acute onset of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain but can be mimicked by many disease processes.",
        "Historically divided into \"typical\" and \"atypical\" syndromes, there is considerable overlap: so-called typical pathogens (e.g., Strep. pneumoniae) can be atypical in presentation and atypical pathogens (e.g., Legionella sp.) may present with a picture of typical pneumonia.",
        "Bacteria and viruses are responsible for the majority of cases. Among bacteria, Strep. pneumoniae and mycoplasma predominate. However, tuberculosis, fungal, and parasitic infections can be confused with CAP. These etiologies should be considered in patients not responding to antibacterial therapy.",
