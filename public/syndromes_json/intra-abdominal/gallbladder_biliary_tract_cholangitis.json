        "The role of enterococci in biliary tract and intraabdominal infections more generally is not well defined. Regimens lacking coverage for enterococci (e.g., ertapenem, cephalosporin + metronidazole) are highly effective. Selecting an agent with activity against enterococci may be important when this is predominant organism or in healthcare-associated infections. Meropenem, Imipenem, and Piperacillin-tazobactam all have good anti-enterococcal activity so additional coverage for this organism is not needed with certain exceptions such as 1) in a liver transplant patient, or 2) in a high-risk patient patient from whom vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was previously isolated in culture, in which case adding linezolid to the regimen should be considered. Third generation cephalosporins do not have anti-enterococcal activity and if this agent is used, the addition of linezolid to the regimen may be considered in high-risk patients or those with healthcare associated infections.",
