        "Orbital cellulitis is a serious, potentially life-threatening, infection involving the fat and ocular muscles of the orbit but not the orbit itself. Cardinal features include ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, visual changes, proptosis and characteristic findings on imaging such as inflammation of extraocular tissues muscles, fat stranding, and anterior displacement of the globe. See StatPearls Publishing; 2022.",
        "Periorbital cellulitis (also called preseptal cellulitis) is infection of the eyelid and surrounding skin and tissues anterior to the orbital septum. It is typically milder than orbital cellulitis, which it may be confused but vision is normal and there is no pain with eye movement.",
