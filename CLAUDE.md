# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **world-class CLSI-based Antibiogram Clinical Decision Support System** built with React + Vite. The system implements a sophisticated 4-phase antibiogram interpretation workflow that mirrors infectious disease specialist reasoning, with two distinct operational modes:

- **Simple Mode**: CLSI-compliant antibiogram interpretation with straightforward recommendations
- **Advanced Mode**: Comprehensive clinical intelligence with comparative therapeutic strategy analysis

The application leverages months of meticulously crafted medical databases to provide pharmaceutical-grade antimicrobial susceptibility testing interpretation.

### ðŸš§ Implementation Gaps & Next Steps

Based on the blueprint analysis, the following areas need implementation or enhancement:

#### **Missing Core Features**
1. **Patient Data Integration**: The AntibiogramMaster workflow doesn't currently collect patient demographics, renal/hepatic function
2. **Site-Specific Breakpoint Selection**: While the engine supports it, the UI doesn't fully leverage site-specific breakpoints (e.g., meningitis vs non-meningeal)
3. **Local Epidemiology Integration**: Framework exists but no data input mechanism
4. **Export/Report Generation**: No clinical report generation for documentation

#### **Database Integration Gaps**
1. **Syndrome Database**: 453 syndrome files exist but aren't integrated into the workflow
2. **Resistance Genotype Database**: `antibacterial_drug_resistance_genotypes.json` not utilized
3. **CLSI Classification**: `clsi_classified_bacteria.json` not fully leveraged

#### **Advanced Mode Enhancements Needed**
1. **PK/PD Module**: Dosing optimization based on patient parameters
2. **Drug Interaction Checking**: Database exists but not implemented
3. **Therapeutic Drug Monitoring**: TDM recommendations not surfaced
4. **Combination Therapy Logic**: Limited implementation

### Key Data Architecture

#### **CLSI-Centric Database Hierarchy**
The application follows a **CLSI-centric database hierarchy** where the CLSI M100â„¢ database serves as the **primary and most critical knowledge source**:

1. **PRIMARY: CLSI Breakpoints** - Core decision-making engine
2. **SECONDARY: Bacterial Profiles** - Clinical context and resistance patterns
3. **SECONDARY: Pharmaceutical Intelligence** - PK/PD and safety data
4. **SECONDARY: Syndrome Protocols** - Site-specific treatment guidelines

#### **4-Phase Specialist Workflow**
The system implements the complete infectious disease specialist reasoning process:

1. **Phase 1: Setting the Stage** - Organism identification and intrinsic resistance
2. **Phase 2: Initial Interpretation** - MIC/disk diffusion interpretation with clinical overrides
3. **Phase 3: Resistance Detection** - Pattern recognition and mechanism inference
4. **Phase 4: Final Plan** - Simple recommendations or comparative strategy analysis

### Key Implementation Decisions
- The 4-phase workflow is the primary implementation following the blueprint
- CLSI database is the PRIMARY source of truth for all decisions
- Simple mode should be default with option to enable advanced mode
- All clinical decisions must be traceable to CLSI standards or peer-reviewed sources
